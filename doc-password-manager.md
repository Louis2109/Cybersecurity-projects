# Characteristics of a Good Password Manager

A robust and secure password manager should exhibit the following characteristics:

## 1. **Strong Security**
   - Encrypts all stored data using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
   - Uses strong, unique master passwords and key derivation functions (e.g., PBKDF2, bcrypt, Argon2).
   - Zero-knowledge architecture: even the service provider cannot access usersâ€™ passwords.

## 2. **Usability**
   - Simple, intuitive user interface for storing, retrieving, and updating passwords.
   - Easy and secure backup and recovery options.
   - Supports password generation for creating strong, random passwords.

## 3. **Cross-Platform Availability**
   - Accessible on multiple platforms (desktop, mobile, browser extensions).
   - Supports secure synchronization across devices.

## 4. **Secure Sharing and Autofill**
   - Provides secure ways to share credentials (when required).
   - Offers autofill capabilities for convenience, with safeguards against phishing.

## 5. **Audit and Monitoring**
   - Detects weak, reused, or compromised passwords.
   - Alerts users of security breaches or unauthorized access attempts.

## 6. **Privacy and Transparency**
   - Respects user privacy; does not track or sell user data.
   - Open source or independently audited for transparency.

## 7. **Resilience and Recovery**
   - Offers secure methods for account recovery without compromising security.
   - Protects against accidental data loss or corruption.

## 8. **Regular Updates**
   - Maintained with regular security updates and vulnerability patches.
