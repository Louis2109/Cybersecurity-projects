# Characteristics of Good Text Encryption

A robust text encryption solution should possess the following characteristics:

## 1. **Strong Security**
   - Utilizes well-established, peer-reviewed cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES, RSA).
   - Ensures resistance against known cryptanalytic attacks.
   - Uses secure key management and storage practices.

## 2. **Confidentiality**
   - Guarantees that only authorized parties can access the plaintext from the ciphertext.
   - Employs mechanisms like unique Initialization Vectors (IVs) and proper use of modes (CBC, GCM, etc.) to prevent pattern leakage.

## 3. **Integrity and Authenticity**
   - Provides mechanisms (such as authentication tags or digital signatures) to detect unauthorized changes to the ciphertext.
   - Confirms that the message has not been tampered with and is from a legitimate sender.

## 4. **Key Management**
   - Keys are generated, distributed, and stored securely.
   - Supports secure key derivation (e.g., PBKDF2, scrypt) and periodic key rotation.

## 5. **Usability**
   - Easy for intended users to encrypt and decrypt messages without introducing errors.
   - Offers clear error messages and guidance for incorrect usage.

## 6. **Performance and Efficiency**
   - Encrypts and decrypts text quickly even for large inputs.
   - Does not consume excessive system resources.

## 7. **Compatibility and Interoperability**
   - Supports common formats and standards for encrypted data.
   - Can interoperate with other systems or libraries using the same algorithms.

## 8. **Flexibility**
   - Allows selection of different algorithms or key sizes based on security needs.
   - Supports optional features like compression before encryption.

## 9. **Scalability**
   - Capable of handling varying sizes of text, from small messages to large documents.

## 10. **Auditability and Logging**
   - Maintains logs (with care not to leak sensitive data) for monitoring and troubleshooting.
   - Facilitates compliance with security policies and standards.

**Note:** Always avoid using custom or proprietary encryption algorithms unless they have been thoroughly vetted by the cryptographic community.
