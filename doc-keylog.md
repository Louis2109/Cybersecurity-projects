# Characteristics of a Good Keylogger

> **Disclaimer:**  
> Keyloggers are considered malicious software when used without explicit, informed consent. The following characteristics are presented for cybersecurity awareness, research, and defensive purposes only.

## 1. **Stealth and Concealment**
   - Operates invisibly in the background without alerting the user.
   - Avoids creating visible windows, icons, or high CPU/memory usage.
   - Evades detection by antivirus and security tools.

## 2. **Persistence**
   - Can survive system reboots and user logouts.
   - Automatically reinstalls or restarts itself if terminated.

## 3. **Comprehensive Data Capture**
   - Accurately records all keystrokes, including special and modifier keys.
   - Optionally logs clipboard data, screenshots, application/window titles, and mouse activity.

## 4. **Data Exfiltration and Storage**
   - Stores logged data securely and reliably, locally or remotely.
   - Periodically sends logs to a remote server, email, or cloud storage.
   - Optionally encrypts or obfuscates logs before transmission.

## 5. **Efficiency**
   - Uses minimal system resources to avoid detection.
   - Does not cause noticeable slowdowns or instability.

## 6. **Configurability**
   - Allows customization of what to capture (e.g., specific applications, time frames, or users).
   - Supports filtering to ignore irrelevant input or sensitive data (for ethical use).

## 7. **Self-Protection**
   - Employs anti-debugging and anti-tampering techniques.
   - Can disable or bypass certain security software or logging.

## 8. **Reliability and Robustness**
   - Handles errors gracefully and recovers from failures.
   - Ensures logs are not lost in the event of a crash or system shutdown.

## 9. **Stealthy Installation and Removal**
   - Installs without drawing attention, often using social engineering or exploits.
   - Can remove itself or clean up traces upon command.
