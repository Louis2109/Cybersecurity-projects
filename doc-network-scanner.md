# Characteristics of a Good Network Vulnerability Scanner

A reliable and effective network vulnerability scanner should have the following characteristics:

## 1. **Comprehensive Detection**
   - Identifies a wide range of known vulnerabilities across operating systems, services, and network devices.
   - Supports regularly updated vulnerability databases (CVEs, vendor advisories).

## 2. **Accuracy**
   - Minimizes false positives and false negatives.
   - Provides clear, actionable information about detected vulnerabilities.

## 3. **Speed and Efficiency**
   - Scans networks quickly without causing undue load or disruption.
   - Supports parallel and scheduled scanning.

## 4. **Customizability**
   - Allows users to customize scans: target selection, port range, protocol filters, and scan depth.
   - Enables inclusion/exclusion lists and custom vulnerability checks.

## 5. **Reporting and Logging**
   - Delivers detailed, easy-to-understand reports.
   - Supports export in various formats (HTML, CSV, JSON).
   - Logs scan activities and results for auditing.

## 6. **Safety and Non-Intrusiveness**
   - Performs scans in a way that avoids crashing or disrupting target systems (safe scanning options).
   - Offers stealth or "low and slow" scan modes.

## 7. **User Interface**
   - Provides a clear CLI or GUI for configuring and running scans.
   - Supports scheduling and automation.

## 8. **Integration and Extensibility**
   - Integrates with vulnerability management and ticketing systems.
   - Supports plugins or scripting for new checks.

## 9. **Authentication Support**
   - Can perform authenticated scans for deeper assessment (optional).

## 10. **Regular Updates**
   - Receives frequent updates to its vulnerability database and scanning engine.

**Note:** Use vulnerability scanners responsibly and only on networks and systems you have explicit authorization to test.
